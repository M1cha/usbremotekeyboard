# usbremotekeyboard

This firmware turns a nrf52840-dongle into a virtual USB-keyboard that can be
remote-controlled via BLE using a python-script reading keyboard input from
stdin.

That way you can quickly plug the dongle into a headless system like a raspberry
pi without using a spare keyboard or unplugging your own from your desktop.
